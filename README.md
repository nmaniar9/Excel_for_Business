Goal: A display of how I use Excel for business analytics in my daily work


### Breakeven analyis

When will a marketing plan breakeven? I use what if analysis and charting to figure out when and at what level of response will a marketing campaign have a net positve for the company. I also use goal seek to find the exact percent at which the campaign becomes profitable.

### Order/Demand planning analysis

How much inventory should you buy? Given demand assumptions and order quantity pricing what is the right amount to buy and remain profitable. This is a common scenario in CPG ordering. Buying in bulk is often cheaper per unit than buying when you need more, but is important to not get carried away and buy more than you can sell. This especially becomes prevelant when dealing with products that have expiration dates.

### Modeling Future Demand

How can we figure out what we will sell at different prices? If we have collected data testing different prices we can model the behavior with different models: linear, power,or exponential, we can predict future cash flows using our models and create data tables that allow us to look at what profits over different ranges. This is useful to detemine cash flows and help with order planning. I use Excels built in models to create trendlines and determine the models equations.

### Future Cash Flow and NPV

Is taking on a new project worth the upfront cost? Using a discounted cash flow model it is easy to discover which projects are worth the investment and which are not viable given the future cash flow projections. I use Excels NPV function to determine the present value.

### Linear Programming with constraints

Looking at multiple scenarios including maximizing investment portfolios and profits as well as minimizing cost. I learned to use a new function "SUMPRODUCT" to multiply "vectors" in Excel. I also use the solver add on in excel to solve the linear programming models. Linear programming is useful for taking on new projects in companies as well as inventory planning. Excels' solver add on can handle many constraints and variables that would be time consuming to do by hand.
